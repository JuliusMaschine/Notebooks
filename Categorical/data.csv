COVID Daily Discussion Thread || Mon 27 December 2021,,,"Here's one reason having lots of people get covid to achieve herd immunity is a bad idea. 80% of people have at least one lasting symptom. Not sure of percentage who get long covid with multiple symptoms. But some if them will be unable to work for life. 

Apart from being miserable for them, it puts a huge strain on health and social welfare systems. Plus it's almost criminal to condemn a child or young person to a life of disability.

Viruses can cause a lot of lasting damage, even flu. It's thought most people with ME, very similar to long covid, got it after having a virus. I know I did. Lost my career, house and health. So just letting everyone get it is not really a great idea. Countries like the US and UK are going to pay a huge price in long-term disability.",10

Child under the age of 10 listed as a Covid death.," 

The MOH, on it's website, is reporting the death of a child under the age of 10, and this is likely to be the youngest death of Covid in NZ. (Caveat, the cause of death is yet to be confirmed!).

If this is a Covid death, this child was too young to be vaccinated, and in the chain of transmission that led to this child dying, there are likely to be individuals who are mask resistant, or vaccine resistant, or both.

It's also likely that if that person had worn a mask, or got the vaccine, that child might still be alive.

We are also dealing with a black market of fraudulent vaccine passes, people protesting mask mandates and refusing to wear them while in possession of bogus mask exemptions not worth the paper they are printed on.

We have doctors issuing worthless vaccine exemptions on the basis of a cursory examination.

We have a small percentge of kiwi's doing whatever they can to circumvent vaccine restrictions, putting all of us at risk, but espcecially our young children and grandchildren.

I hope they enjoy their ""freedom"".

‚ÄúFrom Lynda Wharton: A young Maori boy aged 10 has sadly died today.  He was covid positive at the time of his death. This was discovered only after post death testing, so he presumably had no symptoms of covid while he was alive. While the 6pm news announced that ""a child has died of covid"", the article says ""it is not yet clear if he died of covid or something else"". We need to watch this closely and be very discerning about the languaging.  If indeed this poor little child did die of ""something else"", delivering the wrong message to the terrified parents of New Zealand will only make things worse.  It will of course greatly increase the vaccination rate of our children.‚Äù",1

So‚Ä¶ A symptoms-less 9 year old child of unknown health status died of unexplained reasons and, in the hospital after their death, was tested positive for covid 19?

Even the article says (way down in the middle, mind you) ‚ÄúIt is not yet clear whether the death was caused by Covid-19 or something else.‚Äù

Given what we know about covid, I‚Äôm pretty sure you would know if you HAVE a bad case of covid, let alone if you die of it, don‚Äôt you think? 

Not to mention, it is known that covid tests tend to, at times, show false positives, and also, according to one of the leading experts on Covid, Dr Peter McCollough - ‚ÄúAsymptomatic testing is not FDA cleared or supported by any regulatory bodies‚Äù.

So‚Ä¶ bottom line is this article admits its nothing but assumptions at this point. 

However, since most people won‚Äôt read past the headline the underlying message of ‚Äúyoung child dies of covid‚Äù is still what gets communicated, which, while possible, is still far from being proven, and therefore is **grossly irresponsible journalism**.",9
Child under the age of 10 listed as a Covid death.,,,"Your first statement is categorically false. Vaccines do not increase your chance of death from covid. End of.

I actually disagree with the government counting the deaths of people who died from obviously unrelated things... like the guy who got shot. Which actually means I **also** take the covid death toll with a grain of salt. I also hate how its given anti-vaxxers something to run with. But people do report clearly unrelated deaths to medsafe too.. you lot are never angry about that.

The point I'm trying to make is that if this child died a short while after the vaccine, y'all anti vaxxers would jump on it, even before you have answers. It would definitely be a vaccine-related death, and even if proved otherwise, you'd say the government was covering it up. There are a number of stories where people have had the death of a loved one post vaccine used to promote anti-vax agendas, even if it was unrelated. 

Even if you look at the number of deaths post vaccine reported to medsafe (117), that's 1 death for every 62,820 doses. Subtracting the ones that are ruled out .. its about 1 death for every 120,000. Just one covid death in NZ would be 1 death for every 13000 cases.. ridiculously higher. With 40 reported deaths, it's 1 death for every 325 cases.
